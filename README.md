# Superglance for Scriptable
Superglance is a Scriptable widget for iOS that shows calendar, events and reminders in a neat and compact way:

To use it, just copy the script at `script.js` and paste it in Scriptable. You will also need to change the constants `kCalName` and `kReminderListName` to the name of your desired calendar and reminder list respectively. You can also tweak the coloring of the widget by changing the other constants.

Notice that this was only tested in a 11" iPad Pro so the sizing might be a bit off in other screen dimensions. You will need to tweak the spacing to make it fit. I provide no support and take no responsibility on the use of this code.

The calendar part of this widget was based on the [Upcoming Calendar Indicator](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator) widget by @mvan231. Superglance is under MIT license so you are free to reuse the source code as you see fit. PRs are also appreciated.
